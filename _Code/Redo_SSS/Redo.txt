Need to:
USE NUMPY

1) just convert original one (no pic shares, just direct encrypt/decrypt)

2) make shares (make sure no loss, and you can't see original pictures)

3) scalar downsizing (ask pradeep, look at the homomorphism stuff)

4) #3 question (header probs)



** Ask chat gpt to convert numpy to binary
(look at luna example)
