To implement Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) scheme for images, we need to follow the following steps:

1) Read an image file and obtain its pixel data without changing the header information. The header length for BMP file format is 54 bytes.
2) Divide the pixel data into n shares using the SSS scheme, where n is the number of shares required.
3) Save each share as a separate file and store them securely.
4) To reconstruct the original image, collect any k shares out of n, where k is the minimum number of shares required to reconstruct the original image as per the SSS scheme.
5) Combine the k shares to obtain the original pixel data, and then save the original image.



To demonstrate the homomorphic properties of SSS scheme using the image downscaling operation, we need to follow the following steps:

1) Read an image file and obtain its pixel data without changing the header information.
2) Apply the downscale method on the pixel data to obtain a downscaled image.
3) Divide the pixel data of the original image and the downscaled image into n shares using the SSS scheme, where n is the number of shares required.
4) Apply the downscale method on each share to obtain the downscaled shares.
5) Collect any k downscaled shares out of n, where k is the minimum number of shares required to reconstruct the downscaled image as per the SSS scheme.
6) Reconstruct the downscaled image using the k downscaled shares.
7) Calculate the mean average error between the downscaled image and the reconstructed downscaled image using the provided equation.
8) Report the output of each step and make observations.


Note that in both cases, we need to use a programming language capable of image processing, such as Python with the Pillow library or Matlab, to implement the required operations.
