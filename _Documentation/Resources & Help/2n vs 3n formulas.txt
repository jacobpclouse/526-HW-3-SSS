Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) is a method for splitting a secret into n shares in such a way that any k or more shares can be used to reconstruct the original secret. The k parameter is chosen at the time of the secret sharing process and determines the minimum number of shares required to reconstruct the secret. The most commonly used values of k are 2 and 3.

The main difference between the equations used in SSS with (2,n) and (3,n) lies in the degree of the polynomial used for generating the shares.

In the case of (2,n) SSS, a polynomial of degree 1 is used to generate the shares. The polynomial is of the form:


	f(x) = s + a_1*x

where s is the secret, a_1 is a random coefficient, and x is a distinct non-zero value chosen for each share. Two shares are generated by evaluating this polynomial at two distinct values of x. The shares (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) are then distributed to two different parties. To reconstruct the secret using these two shares, the Lagrange interpolation formula is used to find the value of s:


	s = y_1*(0 - x_2)/(x_1 - x_2) + y_2*(0 - x_1)/(x_2 - x_1)


In the case of (3,n) SSS, a polynomial of degree 2 is used to generate the shares. The polynomial is of the form:


	f(x) = s + a_1*x + a_2*x^2



where s is the secret, a_1 and a_2 are random coefficients, and x is a distinct non-zero value chosen for each share. Three shares are generated by evaluating this polynomial at three distinct values of x. The shares (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) and (x_3, y_3) are then distributed to three different parties. To reconstruct the secret using these three shares, the Lagrange interpolation formula is used to find the value of s:

	s = y_1 * (0-x_2)*(0-x_3)/((x_1-x_2)*(x_1-x_3))
	  + y_2 * (0-x_1)*(0-x_3)/((x_2-x_1)*(x_2-x_3))
	  + y_3 * (0-x_1)*(0-x_2)/((x_3-x_1)*(x_3-x_2))



In summary, the main difference between the equations used in SSS with (2,n) and (3,n) lies in the degree of the polynomial used for generating the shares. (2,n) SSS uses a polynomial of degree 1, while (3,n) SSS uses a polynomial of degree 2.
