To reconstruct the secret using 2 shares in Shamir's Secret Sharing with (2,n) threshold, you need to use the Lagrange interpolation formula, which involves the coordinates of the two shares and a modulus value. The modulus value is typically chosen to be a large prime number.

Assuming you have received two shares, (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), and the modulus value is p, you can reconstruct the secret s as follows:

1) Calculate the Lagrange coefficients:


	l_1 = (0 - x_2) / (x_1 - x_2) mod p
	l_2 = (0 - x_1) / (x_2 - x_1) mod p



2) Reconstruct the secret using the Lagrange interpolation formula:
	s = (l_1 * y_1 + l_2 * y_2) mod p


The Lagrange interpolation formula reconstructs the unique polynomial of degree at most k-1 (where k is the threshold), given k distinct points on the polynomial. In the case of (2,n) SSS, the polynomial is of degree 1, and two shares are sufficient to reconstruct the polynomial and thereby the secret s.
